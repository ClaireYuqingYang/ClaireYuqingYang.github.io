Hi! I’m Claire Yuqing Yang. I am currently an M.S. student in Applied Statistics for Social Science Research at New York University and Development Lead/RA at Columbia Business School (Brane Lab).

Before I am a writer and ran a script-muder game company in China. From 2022, I discovered my interest in behavioral research and started my life as a researcher ever since then.

If I were to describe my research interests through a three-circle Venn diagram, attention, decision-making, and meaning-making in digital environments would occupy the three circles, together forming the space I hope to explore: how technology shapes the experiences through which consumers construct meaning, and how these constructed meanings guide subsequent judgments and choices. 

I also work on large-scale text analysis, LLM-based behavioral experiments, and statistical modeling for social science applications.
